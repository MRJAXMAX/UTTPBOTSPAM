üìõ YouTube Troll Swarm Spam Detection ‚Äî Unicode Obfuscation in the Wild

üö® Summary
This repository documents and analyzes a coordinated troll and bot spam campaign active on YouTube as of July 2025. These bots leverage Unicode control characters (specifically U+202E Right-to-Left Override) to obfuscate key phrases and evade automated spam detection systems.

üìå What‚Äôs Happening?
We are observing dozens of bot accounts, often with "UTTP" in the name (e.g., @UTTPColonelJack, @UTubeTrollPoliceCapt), posting near-identical spam comments on unrelated YouTube videos.

Example Comment (Raw):
plaintext
Copy
Edit
1ST WARNING TROLL! MY VIDEO lS BETTER THAN THIS lNCOHERENT& SOULLESS GPOLSYO
UTTP'S FAR BETTER THAN WHATEVER THIS NONSENSE IS...
Decoded Unicode:
The string GPOLSYO uses the U+202E character to reverse text direction, causing "POLSYO" to render backwards.

When rendered and reversed properly, it becomes something like:

nginx
Copy
Edit
OYSLPOG
This could be a scrambled version of:

‚ÄúGO PSYLOP‚Äù

‚ÄúPSYOP LOG‚Äù

or just nonsense used to confuse filters.

These messages are being spam-posted by dozens of bot accounts, often replying to unrelated or trending content.

‚ö†Ô∏è Why It Matters
Evasion of Moderation: These bots evade YouTube's moderation filters using obscure Unicode characters designed for RTL language rendering (Arabic, Hebrew).

Mass Psychological Spam: The repeated use of "1ST WARNING TROLL!" and militarized usernames implies a manufactured authority ‚Äî part of an online psyop mimicry or intimidation attempt.

Trolling-as-a-Service (TaaS): The pattern and scale suggest these may be commercial spam tools or troll networks, possibly monetizing fake engagement or harassment campaigns.

üî¨ Technical Breakdown
U+202E (Right-to-Left Override):

Injected mid-word to reverse rendering of suspicious phrases.

Not visible in normal YouTube interfaces.

Easily bypasses string-matching spam filters.
Message Pattern:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
"1ST WARNING TROLL! MY VIDEO IS BETTER THAN THIS INCOHERENT & SOULLESS [OBFUSCATED PHRASE]"
"UTTP'S FAR BETTER THAN WHATEVER THIS NONSENSE IS..."
Account Pattern:

Freshly created

All caps names

Military-style ranks (Captain, Colonel)

Prefixes like "UTTP", "TrollPolice", "YTProtect"

üîß Mitigation Proposal
GitHub Tooling (Optional Future Work):

Node/Python script to detect U+202E in YouTube comment exports or scraped threads.

Regex flag for \u202e and inverted phrase rendering.

YouTube Feature Request:

Flag and strip control characters like U+202E unless in RTL language contexts.

Offer a ‚ÄúUnicode sanitation‚Äù toggle for comments.

Enable community moderation tags like #ObfuscatedSpam.

Community Coordination:

Document known spam accounts.

Encourage creators to scan comments using the detection tool.

Submit reports via YouTube‚Äôs Creator Support Form.
